            <h1>Who I Am & Why I'm Here</h1>
            <p class="about-subtitle">The girl on the outside, looking in — since '88</p>
            <div class="about-rule"></div>

                <p>
                    I'm the girl on the outside looking in. I've always been that girl. Growing up in East Tennessee, I learned early that because I was taller and bigger than the other kids — born in the 90th percentile for height — people thought I was ugly and treated me accordingly. Not just other kids. The adults too.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So I knew from a young age that if I wanted any sort of way out, I would have to be smart. I put my education first. I loved reading and learning and discovering new places, people, and cultures through books, the internet, games — anything that could take me beyond the small-minded cruelty of my immediate surroundings.
                </p>
                
                <div class="pull-quote">
                    <p>"I broke out of the cycle because I had to in order to survive."</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    And here's the thing about being on the outside: you see everything. You see what everyone else seems to miss — or what they're too comfortable to acknowledge.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You see the real history of race that the textbooks left out. You see how LGBTQ+ people have existed since long before the time of Sappho, despite what the self-righteous want you to believe. You see how religion gets weaponized into a tool of division. You see how Southern education was systematically underfunded — and how the voucher programs they're pushing now will only make it worse.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You see the ugly truths. And once you see them, you can't unsee them.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Why "The Ugly Truth"?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Because I'd rather have the ugly truth than the most beautiful lie.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We're living in a world of beautiful lies right now. Lies about who we are, where we came from, and what's really happening. Lies dressed up as tradition, as morality, as "the way things have always been."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They haven't. People just don't read history. Or they cherry-pick it to confirm what they already want to believe.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This blog is my corner of the internet where I get to tell the truths that make people uncomfortable. Not because I enjoy making people uncomfortable — but because the comfortable lies are causing real harm.
                </p>
                
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Essays. Opinion pieces. Things I need to say.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Topics will range widely — race and the social construct we built around it, the real history of sexuality and gender, religion as a tool for connection versus control, the systematic failures of education, current events that demand to be examined, and whatever else is on my mind.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm not a journalist. I'm not unbiased. I'm a person with a brain and a heart, and I'm going to tell you what I see from out here on the outside.
                </p>
                
                <div class="pull-quote">
                    <p>"You don't have to agree with me. I'm happy to hear all perspectives. But I'm unbothered by those who disagree."</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    I've been dismissed my whole life. What's one more person looking past me? The difference now is that I have a platform. And I'm going to use it.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Colors</h2>
                
                <p>
                    You might have noticed this site is designed in black and white. That's intentional.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In December 2025, Pantone announced Cloud Dancer — a soft, serene white — as the 2026 Color of the Year. They said it was meant to bring "calm to a chaotic world."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I thought that was pantone-deaf. So we chose our own companion color: <strong>Midnight Ink</strong>, a deep black we're calling "For Those Who Won't." For those who won't speak up, who won't see, who won't stand.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Someone has to. Black and white. The beautiful lie and the ugly truth. You know which one I'd rather have.
                </p>

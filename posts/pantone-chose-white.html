                <p>
                    When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as the 2026 Color of the Year — a soft, serene white meant to bring "calm to a chaotic world" — I felt something twist in my gut.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Calm? <em>Now?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Look, I don't think the folks at Pantone are bad people. I really don't. I think they probably sat in a room somewhere, looked at a world that feels increasingly overwhelming, and genuinely thought: "People are stressed. People are tired. Let's give them something peaceful. Let's give them a blank slate. Let's give them... <em>serenity</em>."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And in their world? That probably felt like a kindness.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But here's the thing I keep coming back to: <strong>we are all living on the same planet, but in totally different worlds.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Pantone's world, "chaos" is something you can float above. Something a soft white hue can soothe. In their world, the appropriate response to turmoil is a "calming influence" and "quiet reflection," as Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, described it to CNN.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But in my world — and maybe in yours — the chaos isn't an aesthetic problem. It's not something a color can fix. The chaos <em>is</em> the policies. It's the deportations, the rollback of rights, the attacks on education, the systematic targeting of vulnerable communities. It's watching the truth get rewritten in real-time and being told to stay calm about it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It's like someone handing you a scented candle while your house is on fire.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <em>"Here, this is calming."</em><br>
                    <em>"Ma'am, I am on fire."</em>
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I'd rather have the ugly truth than the most beautiful lie."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h2>What Pantone Said</h2>
                
                <p>
                    To be fair, let's look at what they actually said. According to NPR's coverage, Cloud Dancer is described as "a lofty white that serves as a symbol of calming influence in a society rediscovering the value of quiet reflection." Laurie Pressman, Vice President of the Pantone Color Institute, explained that "similar to a blank canvas, Cloud Dancer signifies our desire for a fresh start."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    TIME Magazine reported that the choice represents "serenity and tranquility," which Pantone says is ever in need "in a frenetic society." The shade is meant to offer "a promise of clarity" during "this time of transformation."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Fresh start. Blank canvas. Clarity. Transformation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These are beautiful words. And I understand the impulse behind them. I do.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But I can't help noticing that "fresh start" sounds a lot like "let's not dwell on what's happening." And "blank canvas" sounds a lot like "let's erase the uncomfortable parts." And "quiet reflection" sounds a lot like... silence.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Sometimes silence is peace. But sometimes silence is just looking away.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Color They've Never Chosen</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Here's something that struck me: NPR noted that this is the first time in the program's history — since 1999 — that Pantone has chosen a shade of white.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And you know what they've <em>also</em> never chosen in 25+ years?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Black.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They've given us Living Coral and Viva Magenta and Radiant Orchid. They've given us Greenery and Classic Blue and last year's Mocha Mousse. They've covered the whole rainbow.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But black — the color of mourning, of protest, of ink on paper, of the historical record written down in permanent form — that's never made the cut.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And now, in 2026, when the weight of the world feels heavier than ever, they chose... the lightest color they've ever picked. A whisper when some of us needed a voice.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I don't think that's malice. I think it's just... they're living in a different world. A world where the answer to hard times is soft colors. A world where you can opt out of the weight and choose serenity instead.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Must be nice.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Criticism</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I'm not the only one who noticed the disconnect. ARTnews published a piece noting that "at a time when the political significance of whiteness has been at the center of debates across United States and Europe," the choice raised eyebrows. The New York Times fashion correspondent Vanessa Friedman said the choice made "less salubrious associations also leap to mind."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When asked about this, Pantone's VP told the Washington Post that "skin tones did not factor into this at all."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And I believe her. I genuinely do. I believe it didn't occur to them. And maybe that's exactly the problem — when you're insulated enough, certain things just don't occur to you. You're not being hateful. You're just... not seeing. Because you don't have to.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That's the privilege of living in a certain world. You get to not think about things that other people can't escape.
                </p>
                
                <h2>So We Chose Our Own Color</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If Pantone won't name a black, I will.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm calling it <strong>Midnight Ink</strong> — a cool, deep black with blue undertones. The color of 3am when you can't sleep because the world is too heavy. The color of the ink that writes the historical record. The color of bearing witness when others look away.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And I'm giving it a second name: <strong>For Those Who Won't.</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    For those who won't speak up.<br>
                    For those who won't see.<br>
                    For those who won't stand.<br>
                    For those who won't question.<br>
                    For those who won't listen.<br>
                    For those who won't change.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Someone has to. And if it won't be them, it'll be us.
                </p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>
                    So yes, Pantone — we'll take your Cloud Dancer. We'll use your soft, serene white. It's a beautiful color, truly. We'll use it as the space to breathe, the margins on the page, the room for the words to land.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But we're pairing it with the color you didn't choose. The weight you didn't acknowledge. The voice you didn't raise.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Black and white. Light and shadow. The beautiful lie and the ugly truth.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I know which one I'd rather have.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And if you're reading this, I suspect you do too.

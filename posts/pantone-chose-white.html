                    When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as the 2026 Color of the Year — a soft, serene white meant to bring "calm to a chaotic world" — I felt something twist in my gut.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Calm? <em>Now?</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In a world where our national government has made terrible, racist actions against its own people? Where education is being gutted, rights are being stripped, and communities are being torn apart? Where people are being deported, books are being banned, and the truth is being rewritten in real-time?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <em>That's</em> when you want us to feel calm?
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I'd rather have the ugly truth than the most beautiful lie."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>
                    Pantone described Cloud Dancer as "a billowy, balanced white imbued with a feeling of serenity." A "blank canvas" for "new beginnings." A "calming influence in a frenetic society."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But here's what I hear: <em>Look away. Don't engage. Float above it all. Everything is fine.</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It's not fine. And choosing to feel calm right now isn't peace — it's avoidance. It's privilege dressed up as wellness.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Color They Won't Choose</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Pantone has been naming a Color of the Year since 1999. In all that time — over 25 years — they've never chosen black. Not once.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They've given us pinks and blues and corals and greens. They've given us "Viva Magenta" and "Living Coral" and "Radiant Orchid." They've even given us a warm brown called "Mocha Mousse" last year.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But black? The color of mourning? The color of protest? The color of ink on paper, of truth written down in permanent record?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Never.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And now, in 2026 — when the weight of the world has never felt heavier — they chose white. The <em>lightest</em> color they've ever picked. A "whisper of calm."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It's not just tone-deaf. It's a choice. A choice to float above the chaos instead of standing in it.
                </p>
                
                <h2>So We Chose Our Own Color</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If Pantone won't name a black, we will.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We're calling it <strong>Midnight Ink</strong> — a cool, deep black with blue undertones. The color of 3am when you can't sleep because the world is too heavy. The color of the ink that writes the historical record. The color of bearing witness.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And we're giving it a second name: <strong>For Those Who Won't.</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    For those who won't speak up.<br>
                    For those who won't see.<br>
                    For those who won't stand.<br>
                    For those who won't fight.<br>
                    For those who won't listen.<br>
                    For those who won't change.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Someone has to. And if it won't be them, it'll be us.
                </p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>
                    So yes, Pantone — we'll take your Cloud Dancer. We'll use your soft, serene white as the space to breathe, the blank page, the canvas.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But we're pairing it with the color you were too comfortable to choose. The weight you ignored. The truth you avoided.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Black and white. Light and shadow. The beautiful lie and the ugly truth.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We know which one we'd rather have.
                </p>

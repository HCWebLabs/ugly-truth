                <p>
                    I grew up on a dead end street, on the other side of the tracks, in a town so small that most people have never heard of it — and if they have, it's probably as a punchline.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The town has had three names. First it was Coal Creek, named for the black veins that ran through these mountains and the men who died pulling them out. Then it became Lake City, after the TVA dammed the river and flooded the valley in the 1930s. Now it's called Rocky Top — renamed in 2014 after the University of Tennessee fight song, because some developers promised a water park that never came.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Three names. Same place. Same poverty. Same forgetting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Population: about 1,600 people. Median household income, according to the 2000 census: $14,844. A third of families living below the poverty line. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone, where people will give you the last of what they have, and where my neighbor across the street — a grown adult — still cannot read.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is the place that made me. This is the place I still live. And this is the place that taught me everything I know about what America really thinks of its own people.

                <h2>The War They Almost Erased</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Here's something they probably didn't teach you in school — they almost didn't teach it in Tennessee schools either.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 1891, this little town was ground zero for one of the largest labor uprisings in American history. They called it the Coal Creek War.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After the Civil War, Tennessee — like many Southern states — had a problem. The economy was shattered, the prisons were full, and there was money to be made in coal. So the state started leasing convicts to private mining companies. The companies got nearly free labor. The state got paid. And the convicts — mostly Black men, imprisoned on petty charges under Jim Crow laws, some for "stealing as little as an eight-cent fence rail," as the Zinn Education Project documented — got worked to death in the dark.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The mortality rate in Tennessee's leased mines was around 10% per year. Let that sink in.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When the Tennessee Coal Mining Company brought convict laborers to the mines near Briceville — just down the road from where I live — the free miners saw what was happening. This wasn't just about their jobs. This was about a system designed to crush them: replacing paid workers with enslaved ones, driving down wages, breaking strikes before they could start.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So they fought back.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    On July 14, 1891, about 300 armed miners surrounded the stockade at Briceville, freed 40 convicts, and put them on a train to Knoxville. The governor sent the state militia. The miners sent them home too. This happened again and again — miners freeing convicts, the state sending troops, the miners refusing to back down.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    On Halloween night, 1891, masked miners burned the stockades to the ground, freed 300 convicts, dressed them in civilian clothes, and told them: "Go and sin no more."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The state built Fort Anderson — complete with cannons pointed at the town of Coal Creek. They were ready to shell their own citizens to protect the mining companies' profits.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But the miners didn't stop. And in 1893, Tennessee became one of the first Southern states to abolish the convict lease system. Not because politicians had a change of heart. Because workers in this little forgotten valley fought until it was too expensive to keep the machine running.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2017, Tennessee's state board of education proposed removing the Coal Creek War from the curriculum. It took public outcry to pass the Tennessee History Act in 2019, requiring it to be taught.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They almost erased it. The thing that happened right here. The thing that ended a form of slavery. They almost made sure no one would ever know.
                </p>
                
                <!-- SECTION 3: WHAT THE DATA SAYS -->
                
                <h2>What the Numbers Say</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Let me give you some numbers. Not because numbers tell the whole story — they don't — but because sometimes you need receipts.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    According to the Education Data Initiative, Tennessee ranks <strong>43rd in the nation</strong> for per-pupil education spending. We spend about $12,431 per student while the national average is over $20,000. A 2024 report from the National Education Association found that we rank <strong>44th in teacher pay</strong>. Adjusted for inflation, Tennessee teachers make <strong>10.4% less</strong> than they did a decade ago.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The Tennessee Education Report noted that in 2018, Tennessee ranked 42nd in "funding effort" — meaning how hard the state actually tries to fund its schools relative to its capacity. Today? We've dropped to <strong>47th</strong>. We're not just underfunded. We're barely trying.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, according to Chalkbeat Tennessee, the state has a <strong>$9.8 billion backlog</strong> in school facility needs. Buildings crumbling. No air conditioning. No updated textbooks. But somehow we found $1.6 billion for corporate tax breaks and $500 million for a new Titans stadium.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In Tennessee's 52 Appalachian counties — my counties — the Appalachian Learning Initiative reports that the numbers get even worse:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    More than <strong>two out of three adults</strong> read at or below an eighth-grade level. More than <strong>three out of four</strong> struggle with basic math. Nearly <strong>one in five adults</strong> never finished high school. More than <strong>one in four households</strong> earn less than 150% of the federal poverty level.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Where I live, only <strong>8.6% of adults</strong> have a bachelor's degree. The state average is 30%. The national average is 35%.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These aren't just statistics. These are my neighbors. My family. The people I grew up with. The kids I went to school with who never had a chance — not because they weren't smart enough, but because the system was never built to help them.
                </p>
                
                <!-- SECTION 5: THE VOUCHER SCAM -->
                
                <h2>The New War on Public Schools</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In January 2025, Governor Bill Lee called a special legislative session. It lasted four days. In those four days, as Chalkbeat Tennessee reported, lawmakers passed a universal school voucher program — the "Education Freedom Act" — that will give families $7,295 in public money to send their kids to private school.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Sounds great, right? School choice. Freedom. Options.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Here's what they don't tell you:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    According to the legislature's own analysis, <strong>65% of those vouchers</strong> will go to families whose children are already enrolled in private school. This isn't about giving poor kids a way out. It's about subsidizing tuition for families who were already paying it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    WTVF Nashville reported that in the 45 counties they cover, the majority of private schools are concentrated in a handful of urban and suburban counties. Rural counties have <strong>one private school option — or none at all</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Where I live? We don't have a private school to "choose." The nearest ones are in Knoxville, 25 miles away. And $7,295 doesn't cover tuition anyway — most private schools cost significantly more. So who benefits? Not us.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But here's the part that really burns: according to WPLN News, students in Tennessee's existing voucher pilot program have <strong>underperformed their public school peers</strong> on state tests. In Hamilton County, only 18% of voucher students scored proficient in math, compared to 36% of public school students. The "choice" is performing worse — and we're about to expand it statewide.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Tanya Coats, President of the Tennessee Education Association, called it a "voucher scam." As WBIR reported, at least five rural school districts in East Tennessee — including Blount, Greene, Hamblen, and Roane Counties — formally opposed the bill, warning that they would be "first in line to feel the impact when state funding begins to erode." The bill passed anyway.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The teachers got offered a one-time $2,000 bonus as a sweetener. It's taxed. It's not a raise. Educators called it "insulting."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And now, as Chalkbeat reported in November 2025, Tennessee is being sued. Parents and advocacy groups including the ACLU of Tennessee argue the voucher program violates the state constitution's requirement to maintain and support a system of free public schools. Because that's exactly what this is: a violation. A slow bleed. A way to starve public education while pretending to offer "freedom."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They pointed cannons at Coal Creek once to protect corporate profits. Now they just defund us.
                </p>
                
                <!-- SECTION 6: HOW I GOT OUT -->
                
                <h2>How I Survived</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I got out the only way I could: I educated myself.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I was tall and big as a kid — 90th percentile for height — and that meant people decided I was ugly before they ever got to know me. Not just kids. Adults too. Teachers. I learned early that I wasn't going to be the pretty one, the popular one, the one who got chances handed to her.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So I read. Everything I could get my hands on. I used the internet to discover worlds that didn't exist in my town — places, people, cultures, ideas. I taught myself things the school couldn't or wouldn't teach me. I put education first because I understood, even as a kid, that it was the only ladder out of the hole I'd been born into.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I broke out of the cycle because I had to in order to survive.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But here's the thing: I shouldn't have had to fight that hard. No kid should. The fact that I made it doesn't mean the system works. It means I got lucky. I had a mom who worked her fingers to the bone to keep us fed. I had access to books and internet. I had something inside me that refused to quit.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Not everyone has that. And the ones who don't aren't failures — they're casualties of a system that was designed to fail them.
                </p>
                
                <!-- SECTION 7: THE REAL ASK -->

                <p>
                    I'm not asking for pity. I'm not asking for charity. I'm asking for something much harder:

                <p>
                    I'm asking you to <strong>see us</strong>.
                </p>

                    See the history. The Coal Creek miners who fought and died for justice. The 84 men and boys who died in the Cross Mountain mine disaster of 1911. The generations who built this country's infrastructure with their bodies and got nothing in return but black lung and company scrip.

                    See the present. The kids going to schools ranked C-minus. The teachers making less than they did a decade ago. The adults who never learned to read because no one taught them. The slumlords who profit off desperation. The addiction that rushes in wherever hope has been drained out.

                    And see the good. Because it's there. The people who share what little they have. The neighbors who check on each other. The stubborn, beautiful refusal to abandon a place just because everyone else has.

                    We don't need vouchers to private schools we can't access. We don't need tax breaks for corporations that will never build here. We don't need politicians who show up every four years to wave and leave.

                    We need <strong>investment</strong>. Real money in real schools. Teachers paid what they're worth. Buildings that aren't falling apart. Broadband so kids can access the same internet that saved my life. Healthcare that doesn't require driving 25 miles. Jobs that don't kill you.

                    We need you to stop treating us like the problem — and start recognizing that we're the <em>result</em> of problems you created and then ignored.

                    I still live on that dead end street. Same house I grew up in. Same town with three names and one story that never changes.

                <p>
                    But I see it clearly now. I see what was done to this place and why. I see the beautiful lie they tell about "choice" and "freedom" while they drain the last resources from communities like mine.

                    And I'd rather have the ugly truth.

                    I'm still here, on the other side of the tracks. And I'm paying attention.
